Last Update: v1.3.4 in February 2024

Description:
This set of lovingly hand-painted medieval fantasy hex tiles provides an evocative landscape upon which to build an RPG campaign, a video game overworld, a strategy map, or boardgame-like experience. Every pixel of this asset set was hand drawn by myself, personally, so there is no risk to you of copyright infringement. Additionally, you get the satisfaction of supporting a working artist.

Includes hexagonal fantasy terrain tiles that fit into 256x256px cells and a large collection of transparent-background decoration sprites to allow cut & paste customization. Over 120 hex tiles are provided, including a set of basic terrain and 63 locations placed on different terrain biomes, some with multiple variations: burned vs. ripe fields of crops, castles with variously colored roofs, different arrangements of houses in villages, mountain mines, strongholds built from wood and stone, clusters of trees, caves, and more!

- expands upon my basic terrain assets for those interested in making medieval-fantasy themed games
- 125 hex tiles (over 63 unique location types, some on different terrain types, some with multiple variations)  
- painted at 256x384 pixels so that towers, mountains, and trees can overlap the tiles behind 
- includes 143 road tiles for all possible permutations of hex grid roads (some of single variation, some more)
- includes 235 "decor" sprites which can be placed on any background terrain texture (these include versions of the hex locations with the underlying terrain removed)

Location types included: 
- farmland (with burned versions); also includes silo, barn versions
- villages; includes wood, thatched-roof, and burnt-down versions
- many castle & stronghold variations, some ruined; some built of stone, some of wood
- pyramids, oasis, sphinx, lost city
- marketplace, cookhouse, warehouse
- church, scriptorium, graveyard
- windmill, granary
- smithy, inn, alchemist
- forester's cabin
- walled city 
- mines, caves, gated dwarven mine
- stonehenge
- temple & ruined temple
- halfling village
- necromancer's tower
- lava-filled cave
- elven lodge

All assets are included as individual transparent-background png files. The base hex size is 256x256 plus vertical overlap. Decor sprites are of arbitrary size, but generally smaller than the hexes. 

Roads

These have been named in the following format: hexRoad-[direction bit key]-[variation number].

The direction bit key gives a zero or one depending on if the road attaches to that direction in the order of NORTHWEST, NORTHEAST, EAST, SOUTHEAST, SOUTHWEST, WEST. (Think of it like a clock.) So, for example, a straight east-west road would be "001001", while a t-junction connection to West, East, and Southwest would be "001011". The variation number is included so that every piece of road of a certain type and direction doesn't look exactly the same. For most, there's only a 00, but some of the roads of a 01 variation as well. (There were a LOT of road pieces for these, let me tell you, so I didn't do many variations.)

If this is giving you trouble, feel free to drop me an email and I'll try to do a better job explaining it. Or, likely, it's simple enough to just look at the images and figure it out.

Usage

These hexagonal terrain tiles are intended to be drawn so that tiles in rows lower on the screen are drawn overtop of tiles in rows higher on the screen. This will ensure that trees, hills, and mountains will appear to stand up and over features "behind" them. There's also an underground layer for land, water, and void that you can draw to give the impression of additional depth.

Future

Feel free to email me more ideas for tiles; I do update this set from time to time (eventually) and it's always nice to hear what people want. I may also roll off more specialized asset sets based on particular themes over time.

(BTW the most helpful thing you can do for me is leave a written review wherever you purchased these assets. More sales means I have more time to draw tiles. :)
