Hello

##Thank you##
Thank you so much for puchasing my tileset!
Your support is highly valuable to enable me to create more tilesets and other content.
There are many, many plans and ideas but not enough time (money) to work on all of them.
With the purchase of this asset, you contribute to making future updates, tilesets, character packs etc. become a reality.

##Updates##
All updates are free of charge, forever.

##Commercial License##
You can use this tileset in commercial projects, no strings attached.
If you do become rich with a project, I'd appreciate some donations! ;D
You cannot, however, re-distribute the contents of this asset packages in any way, without my consent. 
If you have built a tool and wish to include my assets, please contact me.

##Reviews##
Reviews can help build trust with new customers and are tremendously important.
Negative reviews can have a very strong impact on this fragile trust.
If you feel frustrated with the package, try claiming a refund or get in touch via Discord for further help.
I am very active there and try to give the best support possible and go out of my way to help people get started with my tilesets.
A positive review would mean the world to me, so please consider writing a review if you have it in you!


##GraphicSorting##
All these information are in the above documentation guide as well, with better overview and images to help guide you.
If your isometric tiles look strange, the culprit is in 99% of the case either the TransparencySortingAxis or TilemapRendererMode.
If you are using the Built-In RP:
In the Project Settings, go to ‘Graphics’ in the left hand menu, 
change Camera Settings → Transparency Sort Mode from ‘Default’ to ‘Custom Axis’ 
and change the Axis’ values to: x=0;y=2;z=-0.46 (I am using these values for my art, y=1 also works but I find it to work better when it's set to 2). 
If you are using URP:
You'll have to Set the Transparency SortMode in the Renderer2DData (Create-Rendering-URP 2D Renderer) and assign that into your Universal Render Pipeline Asset, 
which you need to assign in your Graphics Settings - Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings. 
In your Renderer2DData asset, you also have to set the transparency sort axis to x=0;y=2;z=-0.46. 
You can find all these settings in Assets/GoldenSkullStudios/Shared/URP as well for a quick-start.
If your sorting still looks wrong, you'll have to set your Tilemap Renderer's mode to "Individual" instead of "Chunk".
In 99% of the cases, it's either the transparency sort mode or the tilemap renderer's mode.

##Disclaimer##
If any of these links stop working or certain content seems faulty, please contact me and I'll fix it immediately. 
Unity and the internet change so frequently, it is hard to keep up with everything sometimes.

##URP Compatibility##
The project is compatible with URP and has been tested.
I included URP settings, shaders and materials as well as an example scene with a few maps set-up in URP.

##Built-In Compatibility##
All assets have been created and tested with the Built-In Legacy Render Pipeline and are compatible with it. 
As most users are using URP, I will focus future compatibility almost entirely on URP. 
Backwards compatibility cannot be always ensured with all features, like 2DLights etc.
