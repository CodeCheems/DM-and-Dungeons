To set your project up to work with my 2D Isometric Tilesets, please open:
Edit > Project Settings

In there, go to:
Project > Graphics

In the top right, third row from the top, select the center button, the one that looks like two sliders -|--

Click it and load the predefined Graphics Settings that come with my Tilesets.
If you use URP, use the URP one, if not, use the other one.

Further documentation for each individual asset is inside the respective folders.
